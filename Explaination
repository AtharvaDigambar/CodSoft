Loss 
In deep learning, model loss is a measure of how well or poorly your model is performing. It tells you how far off your model's predictions are from the actual (true) values.
Think of it this way:
The loss is a number that shows how wrong the model is.
The lower the loss, the better the model is doing.
The higher the loss, the worse the model is doin

Conv2D
Conv2D (2D Convolution) is a convolutional layer that applies filters (kernels) to a 2D input (like an image) to extract important features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
It's typically used as the first layer in a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28,28,1))
When you set 32 filters, the Conv2D layer will learn 32 different features from the input image. Each of these filters will produce a separate feature map, and the resulting output will have 32 channels.

MaxPooling2D
The MaxPooling2D layer performs a pooling operation by dividing the input into small non-overlapping rectangles (called windows or patches), and for each patch, 
it takes the maximum value. This reduces the spatial size of the input.

Flatten
The Flatten() layer takes the multi-dimensional output from previous layers (like a 2D feature map from a Conv2D layer or a 3D tensor after pooling) and converts it into a 1D array (vector).

Dense(10, activation='softmax')
Dense: A dense (fully connected) layer means that each neuron in this layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. 
This is the most commonly used layer in neural networks for making predictions after feature extraction (usually done by convolutional layers in CNNs)



activation='relu':
Helps to introduce the Non-linear activation function applied after convolution (helps model learn complex patterns).
Range of ReLU: 
[0,+âˆž)

The softmax activation function is used for multi-class classification problems. It converts the raw outputs (logits) from the dense layer into probabilities that sum to 1, 
where each probability represents the likelihood that the input belongs to each class.
